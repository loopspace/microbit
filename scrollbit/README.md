# Scrollbit

These projects use the
[scrollbit](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/micro-bit-uk/products/scroll-bit)
from [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/).

* `scrollbit.py` is a modification of
  [`scrollbit`](https://github.com/pimoroni/micropython-scrollbit) to
  which turns the display upside-down (so that when held, the
  microbit is at the bottom).

* `invaders.py` a simple space-invaders game, tilt control and button
  A to fire.
